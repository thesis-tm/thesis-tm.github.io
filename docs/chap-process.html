<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> PROCESS OF THESIS WRITING &amp; DEFENCE</h1>
<div id="introductory-meeting-and-information-meeting" class="section level2" number="2.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Introductory meeting and information meeting</h2>
<p>In <em>mid-November</em>, the first introductory meeting regarding the thesis process will be held by the thesis course coordinator, for 2 year and 1 year students. The purpose of the meeting is to initiate and inform about the thesis writing process. The focus is on describing the thesis writing process, the structure of the course, inform about important documents and deadlines. There will be an additional information meeting at the commencement of the course, usually in mid-January for 2 year students while in early April for 1 year students. In this information meeting you will receive more specific information regarding the course and important deadlines. Along with information related to finalization of the course will also be provided. You can attend these meeting either in person or virtually.</p>
<p>It is very important to attend these meetings organized since this is your opportunity to ask questions about the thesis writing process. The opportunity to ask questions to the course coordinator beyond these meetings is limited and you will be directed to documents and fellow students.</p>
</div>
<div id="getting-started" class="section level2" number="2.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Getting started</h2>
<div id="group-size" class="section level3" number="2.2.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.1</span> Group size</h3>
<p>The thesis is written in groups of two students. The normal procedure is that you form a group of two students that share the same overall interest in a topic (could be as broad as “supply chain management” or “marketing”).</p>
<p>Based on extensive experience in tutoring theses it is our firm belief that this is an appropriate size. Apart from being an added resource in regards to working hours it seems that the possibility to continuously discuss the theses with a co-author sparks creativity and energizes the thesis writing process. In addition, many students find it relieving to share responsibility and handle critique at the final seminar when they are not alone.</p>
<p>You should actively search for a co-author. If you do not have a co-author in mind you can contact other students through the program portal on PingPong/Canvas. If you have not found one by the time you register for thesis writing, the course coordinator may pair you up with other students with similar interest. You are then to contact these students to discuss if you could find an interest in common. Only in special cases do we allow students to write on your own.</p>
</div>
<div id="first-thing-get-registered" class="section level3" number="2.2.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.2</span> First thing – get registered</h3>
<p>In order to get a tutor assigned to you, course coordinator/examiner needs to know your thesis topic and with whom you will write the thesis. Thus the thesis writing process begins with registering for supervision. This you can do via the program portal on PingPong/Canvas under Two-year/One-year master thesis. Note that all information needs to be filled in order to have a valid registration. Only those with a valid registration will be appointed a tutor.</p>
<p>Updated deadline for registration via program portal on PingPong/Canvas is found in Kronox and PingPong/Canvas.</p>
<p>Following registration you will receive an access to course homepage on PingPong/Canvas which will contain details of how to proceed. The entry requirements for thesis project are stated later in this manual in Chapter <a href="chap-rules.html#chap-rules">3</a> and also in the course syllabus.</p>
</div>
<div id="thesis-topic" class="section level3" number="2.2.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.3</span> Thesis topic</h3>
<p>Ultimately the thesis project validates the quality of the programme. This means that students who master their tools acquired before and during the programme to such a degree that the thesis project touches the science frontier in a specific textile management domain. A student who is able to synthesize his knowledge, understanding, skills, abilities and judgement during the thesis course can be called a Master of Textile Management. Complete learning objectives are stated in the study programme syllabus. The project should address the scientific aspects of a professional textile engineering issue or problem. In order to assure proper scientific level the project is preferably conducted in the proximity of research areas where the Swedish School of Textiles is enrolled. Alternatively enterprises, institutes or other academic organizations with research focus can host the project and offer topics for thesis writing. Companies and organizations may also offer topics for thesis writing. In the case that you choose to cooperate with a company it is your responsibility to make sure to foster the scientific level of the thesis so that it does not become a consultancy report. Make sure to continuously discuss this with your assigned tutor. One possibility is to write the thesis and then offer the company a presentation especially for them (or invite them to the presentation at the graduation event) and focus on the managerial twist then. Thesis writing may not be combined with an internship. You are expected to spend the full semester (i.e. 20 weeks/40 hours per week) on developing the master thesis while one quarter (i.e. 10 weeks/40 hours per week) for a magister thesis.</p>
<p>Another important point to note is that the thesis group are themselves responsible for finding a topic/theme for the thesis. To assure that the student manages the project it is mandatory that students take the initiative to and articulate a topic. It can be done through browsing through topics suggested on PingPong/Canvas, discussing with your teachers or through your own interest. If you find a topic registered on PingPong/Canvas interesting, contact the one that is responsible for that topic directly before you start writing. The thesis coordinator will not keep a stock of ready-made research questions to the students.</p>
</div>
<div id="developing-a-thesis-proposal-and-its-submission" class="section level3" number="2.2.4">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.4</span> Developing a thesis proposal and its submission</h3>
<p>During the thesis registration process via PingPong/Canvas you will have the possibility to submit a one page thesis proposal. The proposal should contain a description of the problem area within a specific field of research that you are interested in. This proposal will be used for designating a tutor to you. You cannot choose tutor but when you register for thesis via PingPong/Canvas you may make two preferences of your choice (for registration form, see Appendix section <a href="chap-appdx.html#chap-appdx">A</a>). The thesis proposal should contain apart from problem area and field of research also an indication on what conceptual lens you are planning to use, empirical material that will be approached and how (method). If the proposal has been developed in relation to a company, researcher or organization this should be clearly specified in the proposal. A proposal that is not sufficient will be handed back for revision. Revision or late hand in may delay the appointment of tutors. Deadline for handing the proposal is found in PingPong/Canvas and Kronox. The thesis proposal template is available on the program portal on PingPong.</p>
<p>The next step in the process is the information meeting (already specified in section <a href="chap-process.html#introductory-meeting-and-information-meeting">2.1</a>).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="supervisiontutoring" class="section level2" number="2.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Supervision/Tutoring</h2>
<p>Tutors will be appointed by course examiner based on a match between the interest of the tutor’s competences and chosen problem area of the students based on the proposal for thesis topic. The course examiner will inform the students about which tutor they have been appointed through PingPong at the start of the course.</p>
<p>Following this, you will receive an email from your assigned tutor, inviting you to the first meeting in your seminar group (the seminar group generally consists of 3-8 theses that the tutor is handling). You should receive this email within 7 days from the Information meeting. If not, please contact the course coordinator. From here on your main contact is the assigned tutor. Authors are advised to use the time leading up to the first seminar for literature studies and to begin crafting their introductory chapter.</p>
<p>Master and Magister theses are generally tutored in two ways. One, via a series of mandatory group seminars (about four and three respectively). In addition to these group seminars, the thesis group can also obtain individual tutoring on their work if they wish to. This has to be arranged per group with the tutor, and be sure to prepare yourself carefully for such meetings. The authors may also seek advice and tutoring from other teachers when it comes to specific issues but this is not to be taken for granted. It is good to inform your tutor of such additional contacts. Matters that could easily be solved by e.g. consulting the literature should not be brought forward to the tutor/other teachers. AND, do not forget that there are probably people in your network that you can use as external readers in the process … you will always benefit from one more reader!!</p>
<div class="info">
<p>
<strong><em>But what is tutoring?</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
Tutoring is guidance only. You are solely responsible for your thesis and should be able to explain and defend all choices you have made in the process. The tutor is there to assist/guide you in the process of making these choices.
</p>
</div>
<div class="danger">
<p>
Tutors are only available during the course and will not give extra supervision after the course has ended. In case of requirement of additional tutoring, a formal requisition has to be made by the student which would then be up for consideration by the Director of Studies in Textile Management. In some cases, only a few additional hours can be allocated, but only during the next thesis course period.
</p>
</div>
<div class="warning">
<p>
The following example shows a possible structure of seminar series. Changes may occur, for example, an additional seminar may be added, etc. All details and changes need to be planned in conversation with the tutor in advance.
</p>
</div>
<div id="seminar-1" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Seminar 1</h3>
<p>The students and the tutor meet for the first time and get to know each other. During this meeting the chosen topic and expectations on the role of the tutor and thesis group respectively should be discussed and clarified. <strong>Each thesis group has prepared a document based on their preliminary idea of topic (the thesis proposal)</strong>. The thesis topic should be approximately delimited. The tutor gives feedback on the idea. A schedule for upcoming meetings is agreed upon.</p>
<p>Depending on the status of the preliminary idea there may be more contacts with the tutor before we enter the stage of seminar 2.</p>
</div>
<div id="seminar-2" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Seminar 2</h3>
<p>The introductory chapter including background, problem discussion and purpose is completed and discussed. The authors also present the first version of their literature study and their ideas concerning methodology, disposition and time planning. <strong>Each group has prepared a working thesis document that is submitted to the tutor and the assigned opponents in advance. The opponents are to submit a detailed opposition to the tutor when the seminar begins</strong>. The tutors will inform you about what thesis you should read and discuss, in advance.</p>
<p>In seminar two and in the following seminars, students are to practice three roles.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The role as author – able to constructively discuss pros and cons in your submitted manuscript.</p></li>
<li><p>The role as opponent – able to identify advantages and shortcomings in a submitted manuscript, and to discuss these in a constructive manner.</p></li>
<li><p>And finally, the role as an active observer – able to listen and reflect on manuscripts where you are not involved either as author or opponent.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The seminars are excellent opportunities to train these roles and are a part of the examination of the course.</p>
</div>
<div id="seminar-3" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Seminar 3</h3>
<div class="info">
<p>
For magister theses as the timeframe is shorter, Seminar 3 and Seminar 4 can be merged into one. This is decided by the tutor in discussion with his/her thesis groups in the Seminar 1)
</p>
</div>
<p>Discussion of the ongoing work with a further focus on frame of reference and methodology. <strong>Again, each group has to prepare a working thesis document that is submitted to the tutor and the assigned opponents in advance.</strong> It should contain a re-worked version of problem, purpose and research questions. It should also describe the theoretical framework and include a proposal for the method of empirical field work, containing e.g. sampling method, survey, interview guide, experimental design or the like. The authors should also present ideas of how to analyse their data. The document is submitted in advance. Assigned opponents are to submit a detailed opposition when the seminar begins.</p>
</div>
<div id="seminar-4" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Seminar 4</h3>
<p>The almost finished manuscript is presented. The result and analysis work should be finalized, along with the discussion and conclusion sections, although this is not the finally edited version. The manuscript is submitted in advance. The opponents are expected to comprehensively analyse the entire manuscript in order to contribute to improvements before the final seminar. <strong>Assigned opponents are to submit a detailed opposition at a time decided by the tutor.</strong></p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="upload-final-draft" class="section level2" number="2.4">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Upload Final draft</h2>
<p>When the final draft of your manuscript is ready to defend you need to upload a PDF version of the manuscript on PingPong/Canvas. There is a general deadline for all theses (see PingPong/Canvas/Kronox). This is, in general, about 7-10 days before the defense dates. You should communicate with your tutor (to seek informal permission) before your submit. From experience, authors who insist on defending their thesis against the advice of their tutor run a high risk of failing.</p>
<p>You will be informed about the presentation/defence schedule, who is your primary grader, opponent(s) and whom you are to oppose on in due time via PingPong/Canvas course page. This information is provided usually within 4 days after the deadline of manuscript submission. When the defence-related information is published/communicated, all submitted manuscripts are uploaded on PingPong/Canvas. As an opponent, you must download the thesis manuscript of the authors who you are opposing from PingPong/Canvas. Additional information about this process will be provided on PingPong/Canvas or by email by the course coordinator.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-final-seminar" class="section level2" number="2.5">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.5</span> The final seminar</h2>
<p>The final seminar for each group consists of 2 components. 1. A defence of own thesis. 2. Acting as the main opponent of 1 assigned thesis group.</p>

<p>The final seminar is chaired by the primary grader of the thesis. It is about 45-60 minutes long per group, with the following approximate distribution of the allotted time:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Presentation of the thesis by the authors, 10 min.</p></li>
<li><p>Opponents presents thesis. 5-10 minutes</p></li>
<li><p>Opponent-author dialogue, led by the opponent, 20 min.</p></li>
<li><p>Questions and comments from the audience, 10 min.</p></li>
<li><p>Primary grader´s questions 5-10 min.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The primary grader can suggest on some changes of the format.</p>
<p>The final seminars are usually held during the final weeks of each term (according to the academic schedule). We expect all thesis authors to be available during the examination weeks. For exact dates and time keep a check on the Thesis course activity under PingPong/Canvas.</p>
<div class="warning">
<p>
Thesis authors are not able to choose the dates for their final seminar and their opposition.
</p>
</div>
<p>Authors who have not finished their thesis by then will be given the opportunity to present it on a later occasion, usually 3 months later (end of August).</p>
<div class="info">
<p>
<strong>As a piece of advice!</strong>
</p>
<p>
The authors must prepare for critique and think through their defense before the final seminar by going through their strengths and weaknesses that they wish to bring up. It is recommended that you let someone read and review the draft before the seminar. A well prepared defense is characterized by the authors showing that they have thought through their choices and that they are well aware of the weaknesses but has handled them the best they could. It should show that these choices have been made by the authors based on a logical arguments and not because they “were advised to do so”. It is also wise that the authors, in the event that the opponents find a weakness they have not prepared for, rather admits that the opponents have a point and engage in a discussion regarding solutions rather then start up a defense based on weak arguments.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="the-opposition" class="section level3" number="2.5.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.5.2</span> The opposition</h3>
<p>The opponents are responsible for ascertaining that the purposes of the seminar are fulfilled, by means of a dialogue with the author. These purposes are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>that the author receives in-depth feedback, in addition to that given by the primary grader, and</p></li>
<li><p>that the seminar becomes an additional learning ground for the author, the audience and the opponent in regards to the art of evaluating works of research.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The opponents are responsible for keeping the dialogue with the authors at an academic level and deliver constructive criticism</strong>. This means that strengths and weaknesses should be discussed, and that the opponent should be prepared to suggest alternative approaches, perspectives, interpretations, etc. It also means that the criticism should be presented in a dialogue with the author.</p>
<p>This often has to do with how the different parts of the thesis are connected to each other. To get the grade passed the opposition can follow an example of the outline presented below:</p>
<p><strong>Before the seminar begins the opponents should hand over their individual oppositions to the primary grader.</strong> The structure of these written documents could also be used for the oral opposition at the defence. The written opposition is an individual examination. Therefore each individual in the student group has to write a unique opposition, using the following structure.</p>
<p>Formulate adequate scientific questions for the defending student group.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>These questions can be related to an overall view (e.g. does it all fit together, how do purpose and theory fit together, how purpose-method fit together, how do theory-method fit together).</p></li>
<li><p>Motivate and argue why each one of these questions are relevant. Why is this question important to ask?</p></li>
<li><p>Describe an alternative solution on how to address the question. How could the authors have done differently? What are the advantages/disadvantages when comparing solutions?</p></li>
<li><p>Discuss other points related to the thesis and the different parts (both major and minor comments can be brought up).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In chapter three the objectives and evaluation criteria (in terms of the learning outcomes) used in the course is presented. These criteria form a good starting point for the formulation of the written opposition. You may work together on the task, but the hand in must be unique for each individual.</p>
<p>However, a fundamental issue is that the opponents should not go through the thesis page by page or even chapter-wise. Instead, most of the allotted time should be devoted to discussing the thesis as a whole and to the specifics which, according to the opponent are critically important in an evaluation of the thesis as a whole.</p>
<div class="danger">
<p>
The opponents should at all cost avoid the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Be overly positive in a general term – it gives the impression that they have not made an effort or are not succeeded in understanding the thesis intrinsically
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
“Tear down” the thesis. Instead they should suggest reasonable alternatives. There is no sense in suggesting a completely different methodology at this point in time – though it might be valuable to discuss what it could have as a part of understanding the limitations of the present study. Don’t go through the thesis page by page.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Mix large and small issues. It gives the impression that the opponents are unable to distinguish details from in-depth issues.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Not allowing the authors to defend or are unable to listen and respond to the arguments presented by the authors.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Devote too much time to formalia. Issues related to language or design should be part of the written opposition but should not be the foundation of a discussion.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.5.3</span> After defence! Submission of thesis for examination</h3>
<p>After defence you can make some changes in the final version of the thesis. These changes are preferred to be <em>minor in nature</em>, i.e. in formalia, that includes correcting of spelling mistakes, minor errors, correcting obvious grammatical faults and similar minor clarifications, before you hand in the final version that will be graded by the graders. Further, the students must prepare a response letter addressing to the concerns raised by the opponents. Accordingly, if the minor changes are made in the manuscript to address the concerns, they must be reported in the response letter. Students can refer to the response template available on pingpong/Canvas or in Appendix section <a href="chap-appdx.html#chap-appdx">A</a>.</p>
<p>Deadline for submission of final thesis is found on PingPong/Canvas and Kronox. After the final seminar there will be a list of thesis numbers published on PingPong/Canvas that you need to add to the front page. Not until you receive the thesis number will you be able to upload the thesis in PDF format on the webpage of University of Borås. You upload/submit the thesis on the following link:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hb.se/en/student/services/submission-of-thesis/" class="uri">https://www.hb.se/en/student/services/submission-of-thesis/</a></p>
<p>When you have uploaded your thesis the following will happen:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The thesis will be checked by Urkund for plagiarism (you find more information about Urkund in the link above)</p></li>
<li><p>The report from Urkund will be sent to the graders who will decide if there is cause to suspect plagiarism</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Students need to upload the following documents via the submission portal:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Thesis report.</p></li>
<li><p>Final Seminar opposition document.</p></li>
<li><p>Self-declared effort agreement. (described in Section <a href="chap-process.html#effort-agreement">2.5.4</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Scientific poster in PDF format. (described in Section <a href="chap-process.html#sec:grad-exit">2.5.7</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Response to the opponent comments.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="warning">
<p>
The self-declaration effort agrement should be submitted separately. It should not be included in the thesis report.
</p>
</div>
<p>In addition, the students need to submit the GDPR form, if any. Please read Section <a href="chap-issues.html#sec:gdpr">5.3</a> for more information.</p>
<p>We have the ambition that all theses at the Swedish School of Textiles and Univeristy of Borås should be archived in <a href="http://hb.diva-portal.org/smash/search.jsf?dswid=-6931" title="Link to DiVA portal">DiVA (a digital archive for academic texts from universities in Sweden)</a>. When you publish your thesis in DiVA it will increase access and visibility for your thesis. It will also make it searchable on Google, as well as in the Swedish databases for theses (Uppsök and Uppsatser.se).</p>
<p>To be able to publish your thesis on DiVA we need your consent. You give your consent when you upload your thesis. The consent is individual which means that all authors of a thesis must upload together.</p>
<div class="warning">

<div id="effort-agreement" class="section level3" number="2.5.4">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.5.4</span> Effort agreement</h3>
<p>The effort agreement is a self-declaration made by the thesis group students of the individual contribution to the thesis both in terms of the process (participation in meetings, total time spent on the thesis) and the final written thesis (e.g. parts that you have written yourself, responsible for formatting etc). To the extent that there have been a clear division of work this should be evident by the agreement.</p>
<p><strong>The template for the effort agreement must be downloaded from thesis course page on PingPong/Canvas (also available in the Appendix section</strong> <a href="chap-appdx.html#chap-appdx">A</a><strong>), filled out, printed and signed by the student.</strong> You are free to add text into the agreement as you feel necessary and would reflect your division of work for the thesis.</p>
<p>In the event that you feel that you are unable to make any distinction in work division you may either use the same text for each effort agreement or write one together – but all students must sign the agreement. It is a formal document and may be used to make a distinction between grades. A <strong>scanned version</strong> of the effort agreement must be uploaded along with the other parts of submission (as mentioned in Section <a href="chap-process.html#after-defence-submission-of-thesis-for-examination">2.5.3</a>)</p>

<div id="feedback-and-grade" class="section level3" number="2.5.5">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.5.5</span> Feedback and Grade</h3>
<p>The course consists of the following elements for grading:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Active participation during the thesis course.</p></li>
<li><p>A written thesis.</p></li>
<li><p>A final seminar that consists of defense of thesis and opposition of another group’s thesis.</p></li>
<li><p>A self-evaluated effort agreement of the thesis writing process.</p></li>
<li><p>A poster to be showcased at the graduation event (EXIT).</p></li>
<li><p>A response letter to opponent comments</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Usually within four weeks after your final defence, you will receive an email with grade sheet that consists of the final grade of the thesis course and a grading motivation jointly made by your graders. This email will be sent by the education administrator on the behalf of examiner. There will be no pre-decision discussions while you wait for the grade.</p>
<p>The grade is based on the ECTS scale with the grades <strong>A, B, C, D, E, F</strong>, and <strong>Fx</strong>. All elements of the course must receive at least the grade E or G in order pass. Only if the thesis is graded <strong>Fx</strong> (in need of revision), the authors make more extensive changes in accordance with the comments made in the grading motivation.</p>
<p>The comments may alter from the comments in the seminar and it is up to the thesis group to interpret the changes needed for the thesis to pass, but you may do any changes you wish during this time. <strong>A clear point-by-point response to comments made on the thesis should be enclosed by the authors during thesis resubmission. The students can use the response template available at the course page on PingPong/Canvas (also available in the Appendix section</strong> <a href="chap-appdx.html#chap-appdx">A</a> <strong>).</strong></p>
<p>There are three opportunities for submitting your thesis within a year (June, August and January) and dates will be available on PingPong/Canvas and Kronox. You do not have to register for the course in these cases. You submit your thesis via the same link that you find under submission of thesis above. If you receive the grade Fx twice you may apply to change primary grader. This is done using the form that is available by the Student center (see link below).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hb.se/en/student/services/forms/" class="uri">https://www.hb.se/en/student/services/forms/</a></p>

<p>
In total you have five opportunities to get the thesis examined. <em>Should you receive the grade Fx the fifth time, you receive the grade F</em>.
</p>
</div>
<p>There may be a scenario that a thesis is awarded a passing grade by the examiner/grader and the authors are not satisfied with the evaluation and want the reassessment of the grade. In such a case, the authors/students are entitled to request a reassessment of the examination. Requests should contain a detailed written account for the reasons.

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.5.7</span> The graduation event EXIT and poster</h3>
<p>During the first week in June there is a graduation event at the Swedish School of Textiles called EXIT that will take place in the Textile Fashion Center. The date for this event is found on PingPong/Canvas and Kronox. This ceremony involves all graduate students at the Swedish School of Textiles including students of Textile engineering and Textile and Fashion Design (that will organize a cat walk) and is open for public.</p>
<div class="warning">
<p>
Due to COVID-19, the current status about the organization of EXIT may change over the due course. Therefore, the abovementioned procedure may vary. More information will be provided in the due course.
</p>
</div>
<p>Participation in EXIT is compulsory in order to receive a total grade on the course via display of a poster related to thesis. This is done order to meet the learning outcomes that relate to communication with different groups and market advanced level of knowledge in textile management by making the findings of your research project accessible to the textile industry and other interested parties. We strongly believe your scientific presentation will benefit from this activity.</p>
<p>The students can also invite themselves company contacts, friends and family on this day. More information regarding the agenda for the day will be available in due time by the EXIT organizing committee.</p>
<div id="poster-exhibition" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Poster Exhibition</h4>
<p>As a part of the graduation event each thesis group will prepare a poster that will be on display at the Textile Fashion Center. The purpose of the posters is to evoke interest for your thesis and its result. It is also a way for you to present yourself to the visitors at the event. Apart from purpose, result and managerial conclusions you must thus focus on catching the interest of the public. You find the logo for the Swedish School of Textiles on the University webpage (see link below). Choose the version “Grundutförande”, “Svart logotype” (black) and Jpg format.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.hb.se/Genvagar/Press-och-media/Logotyper/The-Swedish-School-of-Textiles/" class="uri">http://www.hb.se/Genvagar/Press-och-media/Logotyper/The-Swedish-School-of-Textiles/</a></p>
<p>Important to consider when creating the poster:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Use a clear message/title</p></li>
<li><p>Use pictures but remember to add reference if it is not your own</p></li>
<li><p>You may use color print</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid large paragraphs of text, bullet points create a more accessible impression and are easier to read. Text paragraphs may be used but to save space</p></li>
<li><p>Be frugal about details, use less than in ordinary text</p></li>
<li><p>Positioning – think about how you use the space on your poster. What is the main message? What is supporting arguments?</p></li>
<li><p>The purpose of the study? Why did you do it? What was your main conclusion? Based on what material do you make the conclusions? What are the most significant contributions? How may the results contribute to the textile industry?</p></li>
<li><p>Keep methodology brief</p></li>
<li><p>Present your results in the most attractive way possible. Use figures (not too complex), pictures, tables and colors. Sometimes it might be easier to guide the reader by using text to the pictures and tables. When using multiple figures, don’t put them too close. Give space to each part.</p></li>
<li><p>Tables – consider what do you want to communicate with the table? Use 3D? Colors?</p></li>
<li><p>The findings and managerial implications are important. Give them a logical position so that they are emphasized. Refer back to the thesis for further information.</p></li>
<li><p>References – limit the number of references, use smaller size for the text, choose one font and stick it.</p></li>
<li><p>Choose font freely for the text on the poster but no more than two different.</p></li>
<li><p>Remember that the poster should give an integrated and uniform appearance.</p></li>
<li><p>Be brief, clear and consistent</p></li>
<li><p>Keep your audience in mind when writing the poster. The purpose is to catch their interest and make them interested in learning more – from you or by reading your thesis.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The poster should be in Poster format (70 cm x 100 cm), you are free to choose either landscape or portrait orientation. Make sure to align the measure of the paper before you start designing your poster to avoid blurred pictures, figures and tables. You can use the poster template available in the Appendix section <a href="chap-appdx.html#chap-appdx">A</a>.</p>
<p>The university will print of the scientific poster. Remember to scrutinize the poster closely before sending it. The poster must be submitted in the PDF format on a USB to the Pingpong/Canvas activity one week before EXIT. For exact deadline for submitting the poster see on PingPong/Canvas and Kronox. The course coordinator/examiner will pick up the posters and make sure that they are displayed in time for EXIT.</p>
